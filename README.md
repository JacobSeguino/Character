# Character Creator
The goal of this repo is to create a npc character generator for TTRPGs. I'll be starting with D&D but the goal is to add other systems in it too.

Goals:
- [ ] Name Creator
- [ ] Level & Class
- [ ] Basic personality
- [ ] Stats
- [ ] Allow input to change what you get
- [ ] Background

Nice to have:
- [ ] Discord integration
- [ ] Allow a print out that can be added to roll20.net
- [ ] Campain web to allow easier access to tie them in to an exsiting campain
